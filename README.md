## ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++. It is designed to help learners, interviewees, and developers strengthen their understanding of core computer science concepts.

## âœ… Features
- Linked List â€“ singly linked list with insert, remove, reverse, etc.
- Binary Search Tree (BST) â€“ insert, remove, traversal
- AVL Tree â€“ self-balancing BST for efficient operations
- More structures and algorithms coming soon...

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- Language: C++17
- Header-only style for templates
- Simple test files in main.cpp for each data structure
