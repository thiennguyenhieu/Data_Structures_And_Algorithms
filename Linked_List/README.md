## ðŸ§µ Singly Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in a sequence, but unlike arrays, they are not stored in contiguous memory. Instead, each node contains:
- A data field (key) to store the value
- A pointer (next) to the next node in the sequence

This structure allows dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions or deletions at any position without needing to shift elements.
